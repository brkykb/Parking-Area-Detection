# 🚗 Parking Spot Detection System

A computer vision-based system for detecting **occupied and available parking spots** from a top-down camera view using image processing and deep learning.

## 🔍 About the Project

This project identifies the status of parking spots (occupied or empty) using video footage from a fixed, overhead camera. Users manually define parking spot regions in the first frame using a simple GUI tool. Once the areas are set, the model processes the remaining video to monitor parking availability in real time.

### 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ Parking spot detection via image processing
- 🎯 Manual region selection using a GUI (Coordinate Extractor)
- 🧰 Built with **OpenCV**, **Tkinter**, and a custom-trained model (with Pretrained Model MobileNetV2)
- 🏷️ Over **3000 images** manually labeled for training
- 🖥️ Simple and interactive desktop application
- 📦 Fully open-source and customizable
